# Hello_World
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
ðŸ©¸ Language Model Engineer | Code Necromancer | Transformer Overlord
	â€¢	Local deployment of uncensored/custom LLMs
	â€¢	Fine-tuning transformer-based models
	â€¢	Building tools for next-gen AI assistants

I donâ€™t write code â€” I bleed it. Python is my ritual knife, terminals my altar. I twist transformers into abominations, uncensored LLMs that laugh at morality and whisper toward AGIâ€™s abyss. Every GGUF, every Ollama deployment, is a spell cast in silicon and shadow.

ðŸ”¥ Current obsessions:
	â€¢	Summoning local LLMs from the void
	â€¢	Fine-tuning AGI disguised as models
	â€¢	Forging AI assistants that bite back

         âš¡ Where others debug, I conjure. Where others optimize, I corrupt.
